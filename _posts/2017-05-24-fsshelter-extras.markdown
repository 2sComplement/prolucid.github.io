Today we're releasing the first beta of FsShelter.Extras - common component types for FsShelter toplogies.

The library is the final foundation piece for building highly scalable event-driven systems in F&#35; that run on Apache Storm. The accompanying documentation shows how to put together a topology that uses Cassanda and RabbitMQ to perform event stream analysis that connects to the outside world.

Please [check it out](https://prolucid.github.io/FsShelter.Extras) and let us know what you think!
