Today we're releasing the first beta of FsBunny - F# API for event streaming over RabbitMQ.

The library is a second foundation piece for building highly scalable event-driven systems in F&#35;.
The core idea is that while there are many streams carrying many messages, potentially using variety of serializers, each stream is dedicated to a single type of message serialized using specific serializer. 

With that out of the way we can start building processing topologies, next stop: FsShelter spouts for FsBunny streams!
