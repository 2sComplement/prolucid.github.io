As part of ongoing effort to open-source our technology stack, Yesterday we released first beta of FsCassy - functional F# API for accessing Cassandra database.

The library is a result of 2 years of working with Cassandra from F&#35; and it reflects the needs we have identified:

- support for F&#35; quotations in update expressions
- unit-testable consumers (the implementation needs to be pluggable)
- composable API (adding a new option to the query should have minimal impact on consumers)
- offer a fallback via prepared statements

This is our second stab at the problem, and while the original interface-based DAL worked quite well it wasn't composable and was less than ideal in terms of testability.

Please [check it out](https://prolucid.github.io/FsCassy) and let us know what you think!
