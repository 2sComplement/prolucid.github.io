### Prolucid I/O
At Prolucid we help companies solve complex engineering and development challenges.
On this site we've collected some of the technologies we use, have developed or contributed towards. 
We plan to follow up with news, insights and commentary from the developers.

## F&#35;
Most of the Cloud code we write is in F#, and while we're not affiliated with Microsoft we're collectively and individually are members of [F&#35; Foundation](http://fsharp.org/). We find the language features and productivity a fantastic combination and we hope you'll our contributions useful.
